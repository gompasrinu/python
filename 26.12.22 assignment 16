16I have an array with different numbers, and i have to find minimum, maximum and all the differences of those numbers. I have tried this:

# list of numbers from which we want to find differences. 
list_of_nums = [1, 9, 7, 13, 56, 5]


def find_differences(list_of_nums):
    list_of_nums = list(dict.fromkeys(list_of_nums)) # remove duplicates
    differences = [] # list to keep differences

    for i in list_of_nums:
        for j in list_of_nums:
            if i > j:
                differences.append(i - j)
            elif j > i:
                differences.append(j - i)
            else:
                continue

    differences = list(dict.fromkeys(differences)) # remove duplicates
    return sorted(differences)


differences = find_differences(list_of_nums)


print("All differences: ", differences)
print("Maximum difference: ", max(differences))
print("Minimum difference: ", differences[0])
